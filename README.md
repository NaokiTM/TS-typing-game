# TYPETESTR

A typing game / speed checker, built using a typescript, react, and tailwind stack. kind of a monkeytype clone, although nowhere near as advanced lol

## To play:

use npm install to install dependencies, and npm run dev to start the local development server, from which you can access the site at http://localhost:5173/
